\f0\fs24 \cf0 Unfortunately I did not record the errors as I found them but most of the errors were syntax related.  I did not find any missing commas, but there were missing elements and incorrect spaces throughout.  I am left confused as to why some of my changes fixed some elements but not others.  For example changing the button colors I fixed orange and green but could not get pink to work.  The code is identical so I\'92m stumped as to why that specific element is not working when the others are.}
